# Comparisons

Comparisons allow you to compare two values, you can use it to check if
two values are the same, or if a number is bigger than another number, etc.

```lua
local a = 5
local b = 5
print(a == b)
```

This will print `true`, a comparison will always result in a boolean, which is `true`
or `false`.

The `==` is called a comparison operator or a relational operator. The operator which is being
used here is called the equality operator, it checks if two values are equal.

<Callout>

When comparing, **double equal signs** (`==`) are used, not a single equal sign (`=`).
A single equal sign is used for variable assignments, whereas double equal signs are used to
compare two values to check if they're equal.

## Comparing Numbers

When comparing numbers, you can use the `>` and `<` operators. These check if
a number is greater than a number or smaller than a number, respectively.

```lua
print(9 > 5) -- prints `true`
print(9 < 5) -- prints `false`
```

You can also use `>=` and `<=` to check if they're greator/smaller or equal to.

```lua
print(9 < 9) -- prints `false`
print(9 <= 9) -- prints `true` because 9 is equal to 9
```

## The not equal operator

The not equal operator (`~=`) checks if two values are **not** equal, it does the opposite
of the equality operator (`==`).

```lua
print(9 ~= 9) -- prints `false`
print(5 ~= 9) -- prints `true`
```
