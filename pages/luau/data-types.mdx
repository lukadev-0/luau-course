# Data Types

In the previous chapter we've discussed variables, which are named boxes which hold information inside
of them.

Now, what can a variable store? We've seen it store numbers (like `20`)
and text (like `"Bob"`).

A variable can store much more, the types of things a variable can store is called a **data type**.

## Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic kind of data type, any other data type is created
using these data types. We will only learn about primitive data types for now.

### Number

Pretty self explanetory, a number is any number, it could be an integer, or a number with decimals.

```lua
local myFavoriteNumber = 7
local pi = 3.14159265359
```

<Callout>

You can get the value of pi using `math.pi`, we'll learn about the
math library and other libraries in the future.

</Callout>

### String

A string is a string of characters, or a list of characters, or simply just text.

```lua
local foo = "This is a string!"
print(foo)
```

Strings start with a quote `"` and end with another quote `"`, you can also use
single quotes `'`. If you want to use a quote inside of a string, like this:

```lua
local foo = "The boy said, "Hello!""
```

This will result in an error, it thinks you are trying to end the string. You can
fix this by **escaping** the quote, this is done by putting a backslash infront of it `\`.

```lua
local foo = "The boy said, \"Hello!\""
```

You could also use single quotes:

```lua
local foo = 'The boy said, "Hello!"'
```

### Boolean

A boolean is just `true` or `false`. This could mean yes or no,
or if a condition is true or false, or if something is positive
or negative. Any value with 2 states can be a boolean.

```lua
local foo = true
local bar = false
```

### nil

`nil` is a special keyword which represents nothing. This can be used to specify that a value
does not exist. For example, a `winner` variable which is `nil` if the game resulted in a draw.

```lua
local nothing = nil
```

## The `typeof()` function

`typeof` is a function like `print`, it gives you the type of the value you give it.

```lua
print(typeof("Foo")) -- prints "string"
```
