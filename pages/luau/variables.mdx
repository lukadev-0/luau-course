# Variables

Think of a box. This box has a name on it, and inside the box is a piece of information.
That's basically a variable, its a box where you can store any information you want.

## Defining variables

```lua
local myFavoriteNumber = 7
print(myFavoriteNumber)
```

Try running this code, this code should print "7" to the output.

The above code tells the computer that from now on, there is a variable named `myFavoriteNumber`, and
its initial value is `7`.

This is called **defining a variable**. We've defined a variable named `myFavoriteNumber` and **initialized**
it with the value `7`.

## Assigning Variables

```lua
local myFavoriteNumber = 7
print(myFavoriteNumber) -- prints "7"

myFavoriteNumber = 5
print(myFavoriteNumber) -- prints "5"
```

This code should print 7, followed by a 5.
We're changing the value of this variable to 5.

This is known as an **assignment**, we're assigning or setting the variable to 5.

## Uninitialized Variables

You could also define a variable which doesn't have an initial value.

```lua
local foo
print(foo) -- prints "nil"

foo = 5
print(foo) -- prints "5"
```
