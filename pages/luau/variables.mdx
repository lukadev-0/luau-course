# Variables

Variables are like a box with a name, and inside of this box, you can store a number,
some text, or any piece of information.

## Defining variables

```lua
local myFavoriteNumber = 7
print(myFavoriteNumber)
```

Try running this code, this code should print "7" to the output.

The above code tells the computer that from now on, there is a variable named `myFavoriteNumber`, and
its initial value is `7`.

This is called **defining a variable**, defining a variable is done by typing `local` followed by the
name of the variable, also known as the **identifier**. Then an equal sign (`=`) followed by the initial
value of the variable.

```lua
local identifier = initialValue
```

An identifier can only contain lowercase and uppercase letters from A-Z, digits from 0-9 and underscores (`_`),
it can also not start with a number, meaning `0foo` is invalid.

After defining the variable, you can refer to this variable using the name of the variable, you can then use this
and pass it to *functions* or do math with it.

### What does `local` mean?

`local` is used to specify that the variable is a *local variable*, meaning it is *scoped*. We will learn more about
*Scoping* in the future.

## Assigning Variables

```lua
local myFavoriteNumber = 7
print(myFavoriteNumber) -- prints "7"

myFavoriteNumber = 5
print(myFavoriteNumber) -- prints "5"
```

This code should print 7, followed by a 5.
We're changing the value of this variable to 5.

This is known as an **assignment**, we're assigning or setting the variable to 5.

## Uninitialized Variables

You could also define a variable which doesn't have an initial value.

```lua
local foo
print(foo) -- prints "nil"

foo = 5
print(foo) -- prints "5"
```

## Coding Challenge

<Tabs items={["Challenge", "Solution"]}>
  <Tab>
    Create a variable named `foo` initialized with the value `"Bob"` and print
    the variable `foo`. Then, assign variable `foo` to `"Alice"` and print the variable `foo`.

    ```txt filename="Expected Output"
    Bob
    Alice
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```lua
    local foo = "Bob"
    print(foo)

    foo = "Alice"
    print(foo)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
