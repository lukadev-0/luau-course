# Comments

```lua
-- Hello, this is a comment!
```

Comments are additional text that can be used to explain what a piece of code does. They're
ignored by the computer. To create a comment, just put `--` and followed by any text you want.

```lua
print("Hello world!") -- This should print "Hello world!"
```

<Callout>

Within most code editors, including Roblox Studio, you can select
any text you want and press `CTRL` + `/` in order to comment the
entire selection of text.

</Callout>

## Multi-line comments

You can also create comments which span multiple lines.

Such comment starts with `--[[` and ends with `]]`, you can also start it with
`--[=[` and end it with `]=]`. The start and end must match however, so `--[[ Hello! ]=]` would not work.

```lua
--[[ Hello
  this is
  a multi-line
comment ]]

--[=[
  This is also a multi-line comment.
]=]
```
