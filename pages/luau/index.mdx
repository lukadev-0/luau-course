# Introduction to Luau

[Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable
scripting language derived from Lua.\
What does that mean? I don't know either ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Luau is a scripting language which is based off of Lua 5.1, Luau is used to script Roblox games.

## Creating a script

<Callout>

This is Roblox specific. You can also download Luau as a standalone executable
in [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/Roblox/luau/releases).

</Callout>

Open Roblox Studio and create a new baseplate.

You should have the **Explorer, Properties and Output** windows open. You can do this by going into the view
tab and clicking on the Explorer, Properties and Output buttons.

<p className="mt-6">
  <Image alt={""} src={viewExplorerOutputProperties} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
</p>

Now, lets create a script within `ServerScriptService`.
Hover over `ServerScriptService` until you see a little + appear. Then select Script from within the menu.

<p className="mt-6">
  <Image alt={""} src={insertScript} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
</p>

You should see the script editor appear, if it does not appear, or you've accidentaly closed it,
double-click on the script to open it again.

You should see the following code in the editor.

```lua filename="ServerScriptService.Script"
print("Hello world!")
```

This script will start whenever you play the game, press the Play button in the Home tab.

<p className="mt-6">
  <Image alt={""} src={soloPlay} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
</p>

You should see "Hello world!" appear in the output window.

<p className="mt-6">
  <Image alt={""} src={outputHelloWorld} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
</p>

Now change the script to

```lua filename="ServerScriptService.Script"
print("Hi!")
```

Press play again, the output should now be "Hi!", try making it print anything you want!
