# Introduction to Luau

[Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable
scripting language derived from Lua.\
What does that mean? I don't know either ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Luau is the language used to script Roblox games, if you're looking to learn scripting on Roblox, you're
in the right place!

Luau is derived from Lua 5.1, if you're already experienced with Lua, you should be able to learn very
quickly!

## Getting started

Lets create a script and run it, you can choose between creating a script
on Roblox, or by using Luau as a standalone executable.

<Tabs items={["Roblox", "Standalone (Advanced)"]}>
  <Tab>
    <ol className="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-8">
      <li>
        Open Roblox Studio and create a baseplate.
      </li>

      <li>
        You should have the **Explorer, Properties and Output** windows open. You can do this by going into the view
        tab and clicking on the Explorer, Properties and Output buttons.

        <p className="mt-6">
          <Image alt={""} src={viewExplorerOutputProperties} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Lets create a script within `ServerScriptService`.
        Hover over `ServerScriptService` until you see a little + appear. Then select **Script** from within
        the menu.

        <p className="mt-6">
          <Image alt={""} src={insertScript} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        You should see the script editor appear, if it does not appear, or you've accidentaly closed it,
        double-click on the script to open it again.

        You should see the following code in the editor.

        ```lua filename="ServerScriptService.Script"
        print("Hello world!")
        ```

        This script will start whenever you play the game.

        <p className="mt-6">
          <Image alt={""} src={soloPlay} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        You should see "Hello world!" appear in the output window.

        <p className="mt-6">
          <Image alt={""} src={outputHelloWorld} quality={100} placeholder="blur" />
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Change the script to

        ```lua filename="ServerScriptService.Script"
        print("Hi!")
        ```
      </li>

      <li>
        Press play again, the output should now be "Hi!".
      </li>
    </ol>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <div className="-mt-6">
      <Callout>
        Using Luau as a standalone executable is a bit more complicated, this is not recommended
        unless you're experienced with the command line.
      </Callout>
    </div>

    1. Download Luau from [the latest release](https://github.com/Roblox/luau/releases).
    2. Add the `luau` executable onto your `PATH`
    3. Create a new file named `hello.luau`
    4. Put the following code:

        ```lua filename="hello.luau"
        print("Hello world!")
        ```

    5. In the same directory as the file, run the following command:

        ```zsh
        $ luau hello.luau
        ```

        You should now see "Hello world!" printed in the terminal.

    6. Change the file to

        ```lua filename="hello.luau"
        print("Hi!")
        ```

        Now run the code again, you should now see "Hi!" printed in the terminal.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Coding Challenge

<Tabs items={['Challenge', 'Solution']}>
  <Tab>
    Instead of printing "Hi!" make it print "Howdy!".

    ```txt filename="Expected Output"
    Howdy!
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```lua /Howdy!/
    print("Howdy!")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
