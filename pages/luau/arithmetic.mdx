# Arithmetic

You can do basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, exponentation within code.

```lua
local sum = 1 + 5
```

The above code will put the result of `1 + 5` and put that into the sum variable.
If you print the variable, `6` should be displayed in the output.

The following operations are supported:

  - `+` Addition
  - `-` Subtraction
  - `*` Multiplication
  - `/` Division
  - `^` Exponentation

These symbols are called **Arithmetic Operators**.

You can put anything around these operators, such as variables.

```lua
local side = 5
local area = side ^ 2
```

You can also chain multiple operators.

```lua
local a = 5
local b = 5
local c = 2

print(a + b * c)
```

This will print `15`, not `20` as the order of operations is applied, meaning that multiplication is done before addition.

You can also use paranthesis.

```lua
print((a + b) * c)
```

## Modulo Operation

The modulo (also known as "modulus" or "mod") is the remainder after dividing one number by another.

```lua
local remainder = 5 % 2
print(remainder)
```

This will print the remainder of 5 divided by 2, which is `1`. You can use the modulo
operator to check if a number is even or odd. If `x % 2` is `0` then `x` is even, otherwise
it is odd.
