# Functions

Functions are a really powerful concept in computer science, you've already been using functions the
entire time. `print` and `typeof` are functions.

A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can **call** multiple times. Everytime you do `print()`
this function is called, and a chunk of code is then responsible for displaying the text to the output.

You can also create your own functions, lets create a function that adds two numbers together and
prints the result.

```lua
local function add(a, b)
   print(a + b)
end

add(5, 2)
```
